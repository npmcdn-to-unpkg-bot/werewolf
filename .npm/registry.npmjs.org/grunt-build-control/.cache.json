Once you're familiar with Grunt you can install the plugin with the command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-build-control --save-dev\n```\n\nAfter the plugin has been installed, load it in your Gruntfile with:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-build-control');\n```\n\nor, as is often the case with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generators, your Gruntfile will already load plugins automatically with:\n\n```js\nrequire('load-grunt-tasks')(grunt);\n```\n\n## buildcontrol task\n\n_Run this task with the `grunt buildcontrol` command._\n\nAutomate version control tasks for your project's built code.\n\nKeep built code in sync with source code, maintain multiple branches of built code, commit with automatic messages, and push to remote repositories.\n\n### Setup\n\nYour project must have a compile or build process that outputs code to a subdirectory of the main project.\n\nAdd the build directory to the main project's .gitignore, and make sure the build process doesn't delete .git directories inside the build directory. If you're using a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator these steps are taken care of for you already.\n\n### Options\n\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `dist`  \n\nThe directory that contains your built code.\n\n\n#### branch\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `dist`  \n\nThe branch to commit to.\n\n\n#### remote\nType: `String`  \nValues: `URL|RemoteName|FileSystemPath`  \nDefault: `../`  \n\nThe remote to push to. Common examples include a distribution repository (Heroku or Scalr), your main project's remote (gh-pages branch on Github), or the local project repository itself (`../`).\n\n\n#### remoteBranch\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `''`\n\nThe remote branch to push to. Common usage would be for Heroku's `master` branch\nrequirement.\n\n\n#### login\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `''`\n\nOptional, but provide in conjunction with `token`.  \nOutput from grunt-build-control will mask the login with `<CREDENTIALS>`.  \nThe `remote` will be formatted to include the token and login.  \nex: `https://login@github.com/user/repo.git`\n\n\n#### token\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `''`\n\nOptional, but provide in conjunction with `login`.  \nOutput from grunt-build-control will mask the token with `<TOKEN>`.  \nThe `remote` will be formatted to include the token and login.  \nex: `https://login:token@github.com/user/repo.git`\n\n\n#### commit\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `false`  \n\nCommits built code to `branch`. A new commit is only created if the built code has changed.\n\n\n#### tag\nType: `Boolean` or `String`  \nDefault: `false`  \n\nIf set to a string, adds its value as a lightweight git tag to the local built repo. Try loading your project's package.json as a variable and tagging with `pkg.version`.\n\n\n#### push\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `false`  \n\nPushes `branch` to `remote`. If `tag` is set, pushes the specified tag as well.\n\n\n#### force\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `false`  \n\nPushes `branch` to `remote` with the flag `--force`. This will **NOT** checkout the remote branch, and will **OVERRIDE** `remote` with the repo commits.\n\n\n#### message\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `Built %sourceName% from commit %sourceCommit% on branch %sourceBranch%  `\n\nThe commit message to use when committing. It must be a safe commit message for the command line, with special characters and double quotes escaped.\n\nYou can use the following tokens to print information about the main project:\n\n- `%sourceName%`: The main project's name, read from package.json or the project directory\n- `%sourceBranch%`: The main project's current branch\n- `%sourceCommit%`: The main project's most recent commit\n\n\n#### connectCommits\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `true`  \n\nMake sure that every commit on the built code branch matches a commit on the main project branch. If the main project's working directory has uncommitted changes, a commit task will throw an error.\n\n\n#### shallowFetch\nType: `Boolean`  \nDefault: `false`  \n\nFetches `branch` from `remote` with the flag `--depth=1`. Which makes a shallow clone with a history truncated to the last revision. Might bring some boost on long-history repositories. **Note, you must have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) `> 1.9` to use this option.**\n\n\n#### config\nType: `Object`  \nDefault: `{}`  \n\nOptional [git config](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) settings for the repository when preparing the repository.  \nex: `{'user.name': 'John Doe'}`\n\n\n#### ebDeploy\nType: `Boolean`\nDefault: `false`\n\nOptional way to deploy through Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Make sure that [Elastic Beanstalk CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html) is installed\nand [eb init](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-configuration.html) is configured correctly in the provided `dir` directory.\n\n\n#### ebEnvironmentName\nType: `String`\nDefault: ''\n\nUsed in conjunction with `ebDeploy` to specify a environment name.\n\n\n#### ebOptions\nType: `Object`\nDefaults: `{}`\n\nFor all keys in `ebOptions`, it'll build a `key + value` pair to be passed into `eb deploy`. [Available Options can be found here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-deploy.html).\n\n\n\n### Usage\n\nA common use of grunt-build-control is to commit and push built code to the GitHub pages branch of the main repository, or to the master branch of a git-based deployment server like Heroku.\n\n```js\n// Project configuration.\nvar pkg = require('./package.json');\n\ngrunt.initConfig({\n\n  // Various Grunt tasks...\n\n  buildcontrol: {\n    options: {\n      dir: 'dist',\n      commit: true,\n      push: true,\n      message: 'Built %sourceName% from commit %sourceCommit% on branch %sourceBranch%'\n    },\n    pages: {\n      options: {\n        remote: 'git@github.com:example_user/example_webapp.git',\n        branch: 'gh-pages'\n      }\n    },\n    heroku: {\n      options: {\n        remote: 'git@heroku.com:example-heroku-webapp-1988.git',\n        branch: 'master',\n        tag: pkg.version\n      }\n    },\n    local: {\n      options: {\n        remote: '../',\n        branch: 'build'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\ngrunt.registerTask('build', [\n  // Collection of tasks that build code to the 'dist' directory...\n]);\n```\n\nIn this example a user is working on a Yeoman-based web app, with their project's source code hosted at `git@github.com:example_user/example_webapp.git`. To deploy they first run `grunt build` to build a minified, optimized version of their app into the 'dist' directory.\n\nRunning `grunt buildcontrol:pages` commits the built code to the gh-pages branch of the 'dist/.git' repository and pushes to the gh-pages branch of `git@github.com:example_user/example_webapp.git`.\n\nRunning `grunt buildcontrol:heroku` will commit the built code to the master branch of the 'dist/.git' repository, tag the latest commit in 'dist/.git' with the value of `pkg.version` if the tag doesn't already exist, and push refs and tags to the master branch of `git@heroku.com:example-heroku-webapp-1988.git`.\n\nRunning `grunt buildcontrol:local` will commit the built code to the build branch of the 'dist/.git' repository and push to the build branch of the local source code repository. The local project repository can then be synced with a remote.\n\n#### Working with .gitignores\n\nYou may wish to commit files or directories that are ignored globally or in the source repository (e.g., bower_compontents), or make file inclusion and exclusion the responsibility of the build process alone.\n\nIn order to scope gitignore rules to the build directory only, create a file named 'gitignore' in your source directory:\n\n```shell\n# Unignore everything\n!**/*\n\n# Re-ignore things\n...your ignore rules here\n```\n\nThen copy it to the build directory during your build process as '.gitignore'.\n\n#### Notes\n\nGrunt-build-control deploys to git endpoints. If you want to deploy to a private server [this tutorial by @curtisblackwell ](http://curtisblackwell.com/blog/my-deploy-method-brings-most-of-the-boys-to-the-yard) is a good place to start.\n\n`buildcontrol` will add commits on top of the existing history of the remote branch if available.\n\n`buildcontrol` is a synchronous task, and fetches from your remote before each commit or push. Depending on the location of your remote, the size of commits, and network speed it can be a long running task.\n\nIt's best to run `buildcontrol` manually after your build process or as the last step in a build and deploy task.\n\nIf a git conflict occurs (usually because another user has force-pushed to the deployment server) delete the built code directory and run build and build control again.\n\nDon't check out built code branches while in the main project directory. Differences in untracked files will cause issues.\n\n<!--\n## Todo:\n\n- replace as many porcelain commands as possible with plumbing.\n- describe or list similar projects with limitations?  \n  https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-github-pages  \n  https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-git-dist  \n  https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-git-selective-deploy  \n\n-->\n\n## Contribute\n\nPost bugs and feature requests to the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/grunt-build-control/issues).
